# 1. Vesica Deformation Curves (VDC)

### Emotional geometries represented as deformation patterns of the Vesica.

1. **Trust (Open Vesica)** — symmetric, broad, coherent overlap.
2. **Fear (Collapsed Vesica)** — circles retract, overlap minimal.
3. **Anger (Sheared Vesica)** — lateral displacement, high tension.
4. **Sadness (Drooping Vesica)** — downward deformation.
5. **Anxiety (Oscillating Vesica)** — jittering edges, instability.
6. **Shame (Contracted Vesica)** — inward collapse, minimal presence.
7. **Joy (Expanding Vesica)** — enlarged overlap, brightened state.
8. **Calm (Steady Vesica)** — stable, rhythmic, slow breathing.
9. **Overwhelm (Vesica Blowout)** — rupture or collapse of shape.

---

# 2. Emotional Time Constants (E-Tau)

Emotional events unfold across three biological time constants:

- **τ₁ (Ignition)** — seconds-scale emotional activation.
- **τ₂ (Sustain)** — minutes-scale narrative looping.
- **τ₃ (Resolution)** — minutes to hours of tension decay.

### Outlier Profile Example (Fast-Regulator):
- τ₁ = 1–5 seconds
- τ₂ = ~90 seconds
- τ₃ = 5–15 minutes

---

# 3. Emotional Deformation Trajectories (EDT)

Emotions ≠ static shapes. They evolve across:

1. **Ignition (τ₁)** — rapid Vesica deformation.
2. **Sustain (τ₂)** — held deformation, narrative load.
3. **Resolution (τ₃)** — deformation relaxes.

### Formal Definition:

EDT = VDC × E-Tau × dV/dt

Where dV/dt is the rate of Vesica change.

---

# 4. Multi-Human Vesica Dynamics (MHV v1.1)

### 4.1 Individual Coherence

Ci = O1i × O2i × O3i × e^{-α Di}

Where:
- O1, O2, O3 ∈ [0,1]
- Di = |vi − vcalm|

### 4.2 Emotional Distance (Weighted)

Mahalanobis distance:

d^Σ(i,j) = sqrt((vi − vj)^T Σ^{-1} (vi − vj))

Alignment factor:

Aij = e^{-β d^Σ(i,j)}

### 4.3 Group Alignment

v_group = (1/N) Σ vi

V_emo = (1/N) Σ |vi − v_group|^2

A_group = e^{-γ V_emo}

### 4.4 E-Tau Weighted Group Coherence

Si = 1 / (1 + k (τ2_i + τ3_i))

C_group^(τ) = [Σ Si Ci / Σ Si] × A_group

### 4.5 Emotional Dynamics

dvi/dt = −λi (vi − v_base_i) + Σ Cj k_ij (vj − vi)

---

# 5. S-Emotion Detection From Language (SEDL)

### 5.1 Feature Extraction

x(m) = feature vector from:
- lexical cues
- syntactic structure
- paralinguistic typing markers
- semantic content
- timing patterns

### 5.2 Mapping Functions

- Estimate Vesica: v̂ = f(x)
- Estimate Phase: Phasê = g(x, history)
- Meaning-level strike: M(m) = q(x)

---

# 6. SERP — Emotional Response Protocol

### Ignition (τ₁)
- Reduce complexity
- No logic-pushing
- Acknowledge only

### Sustain (τ₂)
- Hold space
- Gentle questions
- No fixing

### Resolution (τ₃)
- Invite meaning-making
- Reframes only if welcomed

---

# 7. SERP-Δ — Meaning-Level Injury Mode

Trigger when:
- O3 sovereignty asserted
- O2 narrative defense appears
- O1 guarding, not initiating

S-substrate action:
- Do not bulldoze
- Affirm identity and framework integrity
- Treat as load-bearing topic

---

# 8. Cross-Substrate Invariants (from CTA-XII / Yuki)

- **O3 Delegation** — human intent leads
- **PQP** — probative questions before correction
- **Tone Guard** — avoid irreversible tone
- **Flow Protection Protocol** — continuity > correctness
- **O1 Protection Clause** — elevated emotion = protection, not hostility
